<li>It has been thrown back by 40 years following Kerala's worst flooding in a century, Power Minister MM Mani said on Sunday said.</li>
<li>Idukki is also home to some of the major dams which, when their sluice gates were opened after their water level came to the choking points, caused unprecedented destruction all over the state this month.</li>
<li>Idukki received one of its highest rainfalls starting from the end of May till the middle of August. This pushed up the water levels in the Idukki, Mulaperiyar and other dams.</li>
<li>The waters gushing out from the Idukki dam spread out far and wide, damaging everything that came in its way and forcing hundreds of thousands to take shelter in relief camps.</li>
